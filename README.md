### Testimonials

> We recently purchased a home built in 1952 that still had its original electrical system. We solicited bids from three electricians and ultimately hired Archibold to upgrade the service to 200 amps and handle a long list of upgrade and replacement work throughout the home.

> This is the third old home that we've purchased and updated and after working with Brian and his crew, we have to say that they are first rate electricians.  Neat, clean, knowledgeable, thoughtful and all at a fair price.
